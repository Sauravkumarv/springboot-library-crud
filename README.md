# Spring Boot Library CRUD - Demo Module

This directory contains the source code for the **demo** module of the [Spring Boot Library CRUD](https://github.com/Sauravkumarv/springboot-library-crud) project.

## Overview

The **demo** module demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a library system using Spring Boot. It includes all the essential components, such as entities, repositories, services, and controllers, required to perform CRUD operations on library records.

## Structure

Typical folders and their purposes within this module:

- `controller/` — Contains REST controllers for handling HTTP requests.
- `model/` — Contains entity classes representing the data model.
- `repository/` — Contains Spring Data JPA repositories for database access.
- `service/` — Contains service classes implementing business logic.
- `resources/` — Contains configuration files like `application.properties`.

## Features

- Add new books to the library.
- View all books or a specific book by ID.
- Update book details.
- Delete books from the library.
- Uses Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and H2 (in-memory) or another database.
